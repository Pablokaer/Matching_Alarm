# Time Zone Alarm  

This small project aims to make it easier to set alarms based on different time zones. With it, you can select a region and set a time for that region. Then, by choosing a second region, the app will automatically calculate the corresponding time when the alarm will go off.  

## Features  

- **Time Zone Selection**: Choose from **169 countries** available in the list.  
- **Time Conversion**: The code automatically adjusts the alarm time based on the time zone of the selected second region.  
- **Countdown Timer & Alarm**: After selection, a countdown will begin, and the alarm will go off when the set time is reached.  

## How to Use  

1. Select the first region and set the desired time.  
2. Choose a second region to calculate the corresponding alarm time.  
3. Wait for the countdown and receive the alert at the correct time.
